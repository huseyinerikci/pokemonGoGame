# Pokemon Go Game Project
This project simulates a simple Pokemon battle game developed using React.js, HTML, and CSS. In the game, comparisons are made between the two sides according to the EXP values ​​of the Pokemons and which side wins or loses is shown on the screen. Pokemons are displayed with their pictures according to their IDs, and the sides change each time the screen is refreshed.
